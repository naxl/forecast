Your role? To scrape not just any data, but the lifeblood of their entire event—real-time weather insights from this page. The summit’s success hinges on your ability to extract current conditions (humidity, wind speed, temperature — everything down to the UV index), the ever-changing **7-day forecast**, and the detailed table of meteorological minutiae like dew points, visibility, and precipitation probabilities. Yes, even the chance of a rogue sunbeam must be documented!\n","\n","Your weather-hungry clientele demands perfection. You will scrape the **current conditions** section, where the fate of their outdoor meetings lies. Then, delve into the **forecast table** that dictates whether sunglasses or umbrellas will dominate the day. Lastly, gather all the juicy **details from the in-depth weather table** (hourly temperatures, wind patterns, and those ever-so-important rain chances). Their tea parties and pontifications about cloud formations rest on your data scraping prowess. So, will you rise to the challenge and save the summit, or will their umbrellas be left **high** and **dry**?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3e59899e","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-13T07:22:15.507459Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-13T07:22:15.506901Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-13T07:22:15.516794Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-13T07:22:15.515247Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-13T07:22:15.507406Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.002787,"end_time":"2025-01-27T12:44:04.761938","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-01-27T12:44:04.759151","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<hr style = \"border : 3px solid #f1f3f4;
